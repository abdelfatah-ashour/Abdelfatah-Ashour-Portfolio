A Frontend engineer who values learning and growing with people, teams, and technologies.

Presently, I am working as a Frontend Developer at [Simaat](https://simaat.sa/) where I am helping to refactor and build a Auction platform while scaling infrastructure with a focus on security.

Previously I've worked at [Flowtechtics](https://www.flowtechtics.com/) as a Frontend Developer.
